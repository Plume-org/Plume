summary: Multi-user blogging platform, federated over ActivityPub
description: |
  Plume is a federated blogging platform, featuring:
   * A blog-centric approach: you can create as much blogs as you want with your account, to keep your different publications separated.
   * Media management: you can upload pictures to illustrate your articles, but also audio files if you host a podcast, and manage them all from Plume.
   * Federation: Plume is part of a network of interconnected websites called the Fediverse. Each of these websites (often called instances) have their own rules and thematics, but they can all communicate with each other.
   * Collaborative writing: invite other people to your blogs, and write articles together.
