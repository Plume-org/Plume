Plume is a federated blogging engine, based on ActivityPub. It uses the Rocket framework, and Diesel to interact with the database.

It is not yet ready for production use, but we have all the basic features (account management, blogs, articles, comments, etc) and a basic federation.

Feel free to join our Matrix room: `#plume:disroot.org` to discuss about the project!

We also have a [Loomio group](https://framavox.org/g/WK40YHMA/plume) to debate and vote and features. Feel free to join it to take part in Plume's decision process.

For more informations on the different ways to contribute, check out our [contribution page](https://contribute.joinplu.me). We are welcoming any kind of contribution, and you can probably find a way to help.

As we want the various spaces related to the project (GitHub, Matrix, Loomio, etc) to be as safe as possible for everyone, we adopted [a code of conduct](https://github.com/Plume-org/Plume/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read it and make sure you accept it before contributing.
